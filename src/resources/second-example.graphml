<!-- The data in this graph is all available in the public domain but assembling it  -->

<!-- Significant amounts of my own research has gone into into the creation of this  -->
<!-- graph. Aviation has always been a hobby of mine and this has been an            -->
<!-- interesting spare time project. I have tried to error check and curate the      -->
<!-- data which was a really big job but there are almost certainly still errors in  -->
<!-- here. I have also been working at adding more recently announced routes and     -->
<!-- this graph remains a work in progress as time permits.                          -->
<!--                                                                                 -->
<!-- Given that airlines are adding many routes on a weekly basis across the globe   -->
<!-- a static graph such as this one will always be out of date the day it is        -->
<!-- released! Thankfully new airports open less often and I hope I am more or less  -->
<!-- including the majority of airports that have scheduled airline service.         -->
<!--                                                                                 -->
<!-- I do not include many airports without commercial passenger service as it is    -->
<!-- passenger routes that I am most interested in. I also decided for now not to    -->
<!-- include seaplane bases or heliports in the graph even if they offer             -->
<!-- scheduled passenger service. Airports that are classified as only supporting    -->
<!-- general aviation (private planes) and cargo are not included in the graph.      -->
<!-- However, You will find some airports with no flights. This is mainly caused by  -->
<!-- those airports having had commercial service at some prior time and I decided   -->
<!-- to leave them in the graph in case one day in the future, service resumes.      -->
<!--                                                                                 -->
<!-- This graph only models airports and routes it does not attempt to model airlines-->
<!-- or route frequency. For example, the graph can tell you that there is a route   -->
<!-- between LHR and JFK that at least one airline operates but not which airlines   -->
<!-- fly that route nor how many times a day the route is operated. That is an       -->
<!-- exercise for another day and for a bigger graph! The graph also does not        -->
<!-- currently contain any aircraft information.  For the most part I have only      -->
<!-- included scheduled flights flown by commercial airlines. I have included a few  -->
<!-- unusual routes such as the flights from RAF Brize Norton to RAF Ascension Island-->
<!-- continuing on to Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands as I believe this       -->
<!-- represents a significant route and is a sort of pseudo-scheduled flight. I do   -->
<!-- not include routes flown only by freight carriers like FedEx and UPS. I also    -->
<!-- have only mostly included airports with at least one route. There are a few     -->
<!-- exceptions such as St. Helena which is a new airport with service pending, but  -->
<!-- delayed, due to issues with wind shear. Where an airport has no flights but     -->
<!-- remains in the graph it is probably because it was served by commercial airlines-->
<!-- at some point. It is also useful for people learning to search graphs to be able-->
<!-- to query for orphan nodes so for that reason as well I have left them in the    -->
<!-- graph.                                                                          -->

<!-- All of this said, I believe, as a learning tool there is plenty in the graph to -->
<!-- facilitate writing some interesting queries and if you are so inclined for      -->
<!-- producing nice visuals. I hope people have as much fun playing with the graph   -->
